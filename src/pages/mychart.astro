									App Analysis
								</h2>
								<p>
									The login page of MyChart has several design inconsistencies
									that affect its usability. First, the button style is
									inconsistent, with varying font weight, background color,
									size, and border radius. Second, the primary action for this
									page is unclear due to too many buttons and a lack of
									hierarchy. Third, the low contrast is a problem for
									accessibility, as everything is a shade of blue or gray.
									Finally, the page elements are misaligned making the page feel
									cluttered.
								</p>
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">Research</h2>
								<p>
									To gain insights into MyChart's user experience, I usedG2
									Crowd reviews to provided valuable feedback from real users.
									This research helped me to identify some common pain points,
									strengths, and weaknesses of the app, which informed my design
									decisions throughout this case study.
								</p>
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">Personas</h2>
								<p>
									I found it intriguing to redesign a healthcare app because of
									the diverse user base to consider. The app must be accessible
									and user-friendly for all ages, abilities, and cultures.
								</p>
								<p>
									It challenged me to think about users who may have limited
									experience with technology or those with disabilities, such as
									visual or hearing impairments. Additionally, healthcare apps
									serve a diverse demographic,including individuals from
									different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, speaking different
									languages, and having varying levels of health literacy.
								</p>
								<h2>User Flow</h2>
								<p>
									To access the MyChart login page on a desktop involves
									navigating to the healthcare provider's website, finding the
									MyChart login button or link, and entering login credentials
									or creating a new account if necessary.

									Low Fidelity Wireframes
								</h2>
								<p>
									After conducting user research, I began the design process by
									creating low-fidelity wireframes. I explored different design
									concepts, including a stripped-down version as well as a
									version with all the information but organizing it in a way
									that clearly communicates the primary action and purpose of
									the page.
								</p>
								<p>
									This process allowed me to iterate quickly and efficiently
									while ensuring that the final design would meet the needs of
									the app's diverse user base.

									High Fidelity Mockups
								</h2>
								<p>
									After iterating through different low-fidelity wireframes, I
									moved on to creating high-fidelity mockups of the login page.
									With a clearer understanding of the primary action and purpose
									of the page, I was able to add visual design elements such as
									typography, color, and imagery that would enhance the user
									experience.
								</p>
								<p>
									While the high-fidelity mockups represent a significant
									improvement over the original login page design, further
									testing and iteration would be ideal. A/B testing or gathering
									more feedback from users would help to ensure that the
									redesigned login page effectively meets the needs of all users
									and achieves its intended purpose.
								</p>
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">
									Design Decisions
								</h2>
								<p>
									When designing the MyChart login page, I focused on
									establishing a clear element hierarchy to help users navigate
									the page and complete the desired action. Letâ€™s take a closer
									look at the form elements.
								</p>
							</div>
						</SmallContainer>
						<LargeContainer>
							<img title="image here" class="pb-8 pt-16" />
						</LargeContainer>
						<SmallContainer>
							<div class="grid gap-y-4">
								<h3 class="pt-8 text-xl font-medium lg:text-2xl">Heirarchy</h3>
								<p>The four main groups that make up the form are:</p>
								<ul class="grid list-disc gap-y-2 pl-8">
									<li>
										<span class="font-medium">Context:</span> This group includes
										the page title and other contextual elements that help users
										understand what the page is for and what they can expect to accomplish.
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="font-medium">Form Inputs:</span> This group includes
										all the fields that users need to fill in to complete the primary
										action, such as email and password* fields
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="font-medium">Actions:</span> This group includes
										the primary action button that allows users to move forward,
										as well as a secondary action that allows users to switch to
										a different option, in this case, signing in.
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="font-medium">Links:</span> This group includes any
										secondary actions or resources that users may need at this stage
										of the login process.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									To make it easier for users to process each of these groups
									individually, they are separated into distinct divisions with
									clear visual hierarchy.
								</p>
								<p>
									*Note: I did not include a password field. Based on user
									feedback it was clear they struggled with the sign in process
									using a User ID and password. Therefore, I propose using a
									passwordless authentication sign in.
								</p>
							</div>
						</SmallContainer>
						<LargeContainer>

						</LargeContainer>
						<SmallContainer>
							<div class="grid gap-y-4">
								<h3 class="pt-8 text-xl font-medium lg:text-2xl">Grid</h3>
								<p>
									I prioritized consistency and alignment by using an 8-point
									grid system. All spacing is a multiple of the base number.
									This approach ensures that all elements on the page have a
									consistent and harmonious relationship to one another.
								</p>
								<p>
									To maintain the rule of proximity, I ensured that the spacing
									between elements followed the grid system. This meant that
									elements that belonged together, such as those within a
									hierarchy group, were spaced closer together than elements
									that were separate, such as the hierarchy groups themselves.
								</p>
							</div>
						</SmallContainer>
						<LargeContainer>
							<img title="image here" class="pb-8 pt-16" />
						</LargeContainer>
						<SmallContainer>
							<div class="grid gap-y-4">
								<h3 class="pt-8 text-xl font-medium lg:text-2xl">Fonts</h3>
								<p>
									I aimed to create a clear hierarchy and improve on-screen
									readability using one font family, two font weights, and four
									font sizes.
								</p>
								<ul class="grid list-disc gap-y-2 pl-8">
									<li>
										<span class="font-medium">Font Family: Source Sans Pro</span
										>, a popular sans-serif typeface known for its legibility on
										screens
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="font-medium"
											>Font Weight: Regular and Semibold</span
										>, distinguish between headings and body text
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="font-medium">Font Size: 16, 18, 20, 36</span>,
										larger sizes used for headings and buttons help them stand
										out
									</li>
								</ul>

							<div class="grid gap-y-4">
								<h3 class="pt-8 text-xl font-medium lg:text-2xl">
									Accessibility
								</h3>
								<p>
									I prioritized accessibility and ensured all page elements met
									minimum contrast requirements.
								</p>
								<p>
									In addition to meeting accessibility guidelines, I aimed to
									use clear and concise language throughout the form element to
									avoid confusion and help users quickly understand the purpose
									and primary action of the page.
								</p>
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">
									To Wrap Up
								</h2>
								<p>
									Of course design is never done. Even after implementing this
									redesign, there is always room for improvement. It's important
									to track how the updated sign in page performs over time to
									identify areas for further refinement.
