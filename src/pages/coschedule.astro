									About Google's Core Web Vitals
								</h2>
								<p>
									Google Core Web Vitals are a set of criteria that Google uses
									to evaluate the quality of user experience on websites.
									Introduced in 2020, Google made Core Web Vitals an official
									ranking factor in mid-2021. This move underscores the
									importance of user experience in online businesses.
								</p>
								<p>
									The Core Web Vitals measure three aspects of user experience,
									including largest contentful paint, first input delay, and
									cumulative layout shift. By paying attention to these metrics,
									website owners can optimize their websites and provide a
									better experience for their users with faster page loads,
									improved interactivity, and visual stability.

									What problem are we solving?
								</h2>
								<p>
									At CoSchedule, we faced two significant challenges that led us
									to rebuild our website. Firstly, we noticed a decline in
									website traffic, which required an urgent solution. Secondly,
									our website was failing to meet the standards of Google's Core
									Web Vitals, which was hurting our search engine rankings and
									user experience.

						</LargeContainer>
						<SmallContainer>
							<div class="grid gap-y-4">
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">Before</h2>
								<p>
									To understand how our website was being experienced by users
									we used Google's CrUx (Chrome UX) report. The report revealed
									that more that half of users were experiencing page load times
									greater than 2.5s, this was hurting us the most. 92% of users
									were experiencing good page interactivity, which is not bad.
									And 20% of users were experiencing some layout shift or visual
									disturbance.

						</LargeContainer>
						<SmallContainer>
							<div class="grid gap-y-4">
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">Work</h2>
								<p>
									To solve these problems, we decided to rewrite the website in
									Typescript on the Next.js framework, replacing the old PHP
									codebase. This move allowed us to take advantage of Next.js's
									built-in SEO capabilities, including image optimization and
									preloading pages, among other benefits.
								</p>
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">Approach</h2>
								<p>
									We took a phased approach to the conversion, prioritizing
									templates with the most pages and page views first, like the
									blog. Then completed more technical pages, including two ember
									applications. And finally the simple static pages. We also
									took this time to review pages that had little to no traffic
									or were simply unnecessary and deleted and implemented
									redirects for those pages.

									Improvements
								</h2>
								<p>
									During the conversion process we made several improvements to
									the site.
								</p>
								<p>
									First, we implemented ContentKing. This tool keeps an eye on
									the health and performance of the website. As changes are
									made, such as updates to meta tags, or links becoming broken,
									we are notified and can evaluate and fix any issues.
								</p>
								<p>
									Second, we made use of Google Search Console. This tool
									allowed us to monitor the site's performance in search
									results, and we were able to use the data to make further
									improvements to the site's SEO.
								</p>
								<p>
									The third key improvement was developing content hubs. Content
									hubs provide a way to organize pages around a central theme.
									The nested structure helps search engine algorithms more
									easily understand the content's context and relevance, which
									can lead to better rankings and increased traffic.
								</p>
								<p>
									Finally, as a result of rewriting the codebase, we were able
									to eliminate poor coding practices and implement semantic
									HTML, which improved the accessibility and search engine
									optimization of the site.
								</p>
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">Results</h2>
								<p>
									In total we converted over 2280 pages. This breaks down into
									69 templates now shared across multiple pages, and two ember
									applications. 100 pages were retired.
								</p>
								<p>
									The website passes all Google's Core Web Vitals. Our website
									achieved significant improvements, with 76% of users
									experiencing page load times less than 2.5s, 94% of users
									experiencing good page interactivity, and only 7% of users
									experiencing layout shift or visual disturbance.
								</p>
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">Impact</h2>
								<p>
									Overall, the website saw an improvement in search engine
									rankings, resulting in the highest organic traffic in our
									company's history. It is also more reliable and faster, making
									it easier for users to sign up and schedule product demos.
								</p>
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">
									What I Learned
								</h2>
								<p>
									For this project I took a deep dive into understanding the
									technical side of search engine optimization (SEO) including:
								</p>
								<ul class="grid list-disc gap-y-2 pl-8">
									<li>
										Semantic HTML which has a significant impact on how web
										crawlers read and understand the content of a webpage, as it
										provides clear and structured information about the purpose
										and meaning of each element on the page.
									</li>
									<li>
										Structured data which is a way to mark up the content on
										your website in a way that search engines can understand it
										better.
									</li>
									<li>
										The importance of elements such as breadcrumbs and a table
										of contents to help establish a clear hierarchy for your
										site and a quick overview of the content on the page. These
										elements not only help users, but also help search engines
										understand the relationships between pages on your site.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									This project provided me the opportunity to learn light
									JavaScript and React, how to leverage components to create
									reusable code, and how to use CSS modules to modularize and
									maintain CSS code.
								</p>
								<h2 class="pt-8 text-2xl font-medium lg:text-3xl">Wrap Up</h2>
								<p>
									The conversion of the CoSchedule website from PHP to React
									using Next.js was a massive undertaking, but the team's
									efforts were well worth it. This solid foundation will serve
									the team well for years to come.
